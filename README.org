* Users API

A simple API for managing users.

* Running Users API

Running the service is trivially easy as follows, assuming you're in
the top-level directory of this repo:

#+BEGIN_SRC
python -m users
#+END_SRC

This runs in development mode, with automatic reloading, on port 5000.

* Development Log and Notes

- <2020-02-08 Sat 13:05> Initial setup. Learning a lot about Flask,
  this is fun. Basic app running with a trivial healthcheck and
  simple 404 handler
